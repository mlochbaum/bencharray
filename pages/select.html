<p>CBQN uses AVX2 for most cases of selection, with shuffles on small <code>𝕩</code> sizes and the gather instruction on larger ones (unfortunately gather is slower than scalar code prior to Skylake in 2015). AVX2 can shuffle 16 bytes or 8 4-byte values in one instruction, giving the various steps as BQN blends more registers together. The 16KB benchmark shows these small sizes better where the 1e6-element benchmark is limited by write bandwidth. selection from a boolean array is usually slower because it requires reading the right byte from memory and then picking out the right bit within it, but for larger <code>𝕩</code> it takes up less cache space and can be faster. For a small <code>𝕩</code> but large <code>𝕨</code>, <code>𝕩</code> is temporarily converted to 1-byte values so that it runs at the same speed as 1-byte selection.</p>

<p>The permutation benchmark doesn't reveal much more, but does show degraded performance for booleans, because when the data is no longer than the indices it's not helpful to do the 1-byte conversion any more.</p>

<p>For odd-size cells, CBQN has a system of movement functions that work like memcpy but are each optimized for a range of lengths (of course, memcpy itself is used for large enough cells). With function call overhead these are much slower than the dedicated code used for type-width cells.</p>
